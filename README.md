# Technical_Conference_Planning
The final group deliverables for planning the TGIF Conference includes a Project Plan, Cost Estimate, Project Schedule with resources, and Project Presentation.
The Project Plan defines the project scope, providing the project objective, charter,  and Work Breakdown Structure, summary of the cost estimate, and schedule summary.  The cost estimate provides the detailed budget for the project. The project schedule provides activity duration and dependencies along with resource allocations. 
Note, the Cost column of the project schedule should equal the total of the cost estimate.
